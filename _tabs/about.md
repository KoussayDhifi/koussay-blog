Hello! I’m **Koussay Dhifi**, a passionate cybersecurity student and software engineering graduate based in Tunisia.

Right now, I'm completing my final year in Software Engineering and working on my PFE (Projet de Fin d'Études). I have a strong interest in computer networks, cybersecurity, cryptographic research, and ethical hacking. I enjoy building projects that tackle aspects of cybersecurity like **information-gathering**, **cryptography**, **networking** and more.

Welcome to my blog! Here, I write about my journey through the computer science realm, especially in cybersecurity.

On this personal blog, you’ll find:

📚 Research articles about cybersecurity topics like cryptography, network protocols, and system security.  
🔒 Hands-on projects and experiments with security tools and concepts.  
🛠 Reflections on learning journeys, certifications, and academic experiences.

I believe in the importance of cumulative learning, sharing knowledge, and personal privacy on the internet.

When I’m not coding or researching, you might find me:

- Debating in tournaments 🗣  
- Writing technical blogs ✍️  
- Or diving deep into new tech news 🚀
